## Friction Logs / Retrospective

- For the frontend, React and JavaScript knowledge are assumed which is fine, but if the developer doesn't have a basic understanding of those two things then those should be reviewed first
- For the backend, it's fine if the developer doesn't have Solidity experience, however they should have knowledge of OOP on some level to follow and understand the code pattern.
- If the developer doesn't have knowledge of smart contracts before this it's still fine to start, however reading the resources in **1. Understand the Smart Contract Basics** of the [Getting Started](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/#getting-started) section in the Solidity docs was massively helpful in understanding the direction and purpose. Would highly recommend going through that first.
- Meta Mask webpages did not render properly for me in Chrome (I may need to check/upgrade my version). To set up a wallet for the first time I switched to Firefox and everything worked as expected.
- The Ropsten test faucet shared in the tutorial didn't work for me. Constantly got the error `You are greylisted for another 0 hours and 0 minutes`. I searched around for other test faucet's and tried a few, however it did take about 30 minutes (maybe longer) to see the test ETH in my account. Because of this I'm not sure exactly which resource eventually sent it. With that said, none of the websites I tried required me to create an account, so I would avoid the ones that ask.
- Nader provides a main repository to reference and copy code from, but the developer instructor in me recommends pausing the video when he pastes in functions and actually typing each line. It takes longer but it will reinforce the concepts and procedure much better.
- While the video tutorial was one hour, it took about four hours for me to complete. I find this to be on average with the amount of time it takes to complete a one hour video tutorial of new concepts. So, if this is the developer's first exposure to web3 / smart contracts / Solidity, they should plan their time accordingly.
- Overall, this was incredible and painless. Honestly, the most difficult part for me was remembering how to spell Ethereum :)
